I'm passionate about many things, one of which being my style.

Let's define style as something cohesive - this style is composed of every
aspect of one's life, from how they present themselves with their clothing to
their organizational systems and their attitude towards their work.

The curation of a set of strong, cohesive principles are able to strengthen the ability of an
individual to exude greater confidence, enhance productivity, and improve
livelihood. Living by these principles explicitly, rather than implicitly (or
not at all) holds one accountable to themselves, rather than permitting
exceptions to the rules and principles they'd like to live their lives by.

With this in mind, we can develop this idea of ourselves by defining a concrete
set of principles for one to follow in their life. These principles are
different for every individual; everyone has their own history, objectives, and
motivations, so it's impossible to craft some universal set of values. However,
we can develop heuristics for developing these values. I'll explain some of mine
here.
