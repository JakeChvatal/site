#+TITLE: jacob.chvatal.com

This is the index of my personal website, found [[https://jacob.chvatal.com][here]].
It's designed to be minimal, providing a brief overview of who I am as well as a variety of links to other services with no JavaScript involved.
No frameworks, no nonsense. Why load several megabytes of data if I only need ~3 kb for something that looks good and conveys all of the right information?
