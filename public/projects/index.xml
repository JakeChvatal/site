      <description>This website is written with org-mode, powered by Hugo, and hosted with Netlify.
Why?
I had several needs for making this website.
 Easily updatable. My last website was my first serious attempt at web development without using a framework - making use only of HTML, CSS and Javascript - and hosted on an archaic static site deployment platform. As impressive as the Three.js visualizations on the site were, I had to dive into the code, then drag-and-drop upload the individual files to a host.</description>

      <description>At CDK Global, I leveraged React.js and Redux to, along with a high school intern and two college interns, develop software used by an internal credit reporting team to monitor the number of credit checks made by individual car dealerships.
Tech Stack We built a full-stack web application with a React.js front-end, making use of both Material UI and CDK Global&#39;s proprietary React components as well as Redux and thunk for asynchronous global state management.</description>
