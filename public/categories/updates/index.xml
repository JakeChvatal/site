      <description>This website is written with org-mode, powered by Hugo, and hosted with Netlify.
Why?
I had several needs for making this website.
 Easily updatable. My last website was my first serious attempt at web development without using a framework - making use only of HTML, CSS and Javascript - and hosted on an archaic static site deployment platform. As impressive as the Three.js visualizations on the site were, I had to dive into the code, then drag-and-drop upload the individual files to a host.</description>
